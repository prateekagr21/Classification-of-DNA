# Classification Model for DNA sequence

A Classification model which can predict a gene's function of a certain species based on their DNA Sequence \
This has been done using Natural Language Processing. 

Here, I have taken dataset of 2 different species and trained my model on each. 

The first one, is of the Human DNA sequence \
And for the other one, I have taken the DNA Sequence of a Chimpanzee. 

Got a pretty good accuracy score of the predicted model.
